## Style Guidelines:

- Primary Color: Soft Rose Pink (#E88CA8). This luxurious and feminine hue (HSL: 339, 61%, 73%) provides vibrancy, setting a premium and emotional tone that captures the essence of both heritage and modern boutique elegance.
- Background Color: Very Light Blush (#FAF0F4). A clean, soft, and modern canvas (HSL: 339, 15%, 98%) subtly complementing the primary rose pink by sharing its hue, yet heavily desaturated and bright to accentuate content while aligning with a light iOS-inspired aesthetic.
- Main Accent Color: Deep Wine / Maroon (#8B1E3F). This rich and deep accent (HSL: 341, 60%, 31%) provides a luxurious contrast to the soft rose primary. Its darker tone and increased saturation evoke premium elegance, perfect for key calls-to-action and important highlights.
- Highlight Accent: Royal Gold (#C6A75E). An additional accent color (HSL: 41, 56%, 63%) symbolizing luxury and sophistication, ideal for small decorative elements, special badging, or delicate lines, enhancing the premium feel.
- Text Primary Color: Dark Charcoal (#2A2A2A). A deep, achromatic tone (HSL: 0, 0%, 16%) that provides excellent readability and sharp contrast against light backgrounds, embodying sophistication and modernity without harshness.
- Headline Font: 'Belleza' (humanist sans-serif), offering a contemporary and art-inspired feel. Body Text Font: 'Alegreya' (humanist serif), chosen for its elegant, intellectual, and comfortable readability, complementing Belleza for extensive content like product descriptions.
- All icons will adhere to a soft-line minimal style, ensuring they are clean, modern, and harmonious with the elegant, glass-effect UI. Icons will reflect concepts related to heritage, quality, and boutique fashion.
